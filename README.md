In this project, I‚Äôll walk you though creating a multi-step JavaScript quiz which you‚Äôll be able to adapt to your needs and add to your own site. If you‚Äôd like to see what we‚Äôll be ending up with, you can skip ahead and see [the working quiz](https://adishisood.github.io/Quiz-Module/)

# The Basic Structure of this JavaScript Quiz
Ideally, we want the quiz‚Äôs questions and answers to be in our JavaScript code and have our script automatically generate the quiz. That way, we won‚Äôt need to write a lot of repetitive markup, and we can add and remove questions easily.

To set up the structure of our JavaScript quiz, we‚Äôll need to start with the following HTML:

- < div >: to hold the quiz
- < button >: to submit the quiz
- < div >: to display the results
